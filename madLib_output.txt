"Music is the soul of the  asdf ," said Pluto. "Music is music is music," said rap  asdf , I. B. Cool. These two  asdf  philosophers were right on! When the beat is right, who among us hasn't felt the  adsf  urge to snap his/her  adsf  or stop his/her  asdf  or break out in a/an  adsf   asdf ? There's no denying that music, whether it's a classical  asdf  by Beethoven or a contemporary  asdff  by the Back Street  adfs , is a/an  fads  influence on our daily  asdf . Music does indeed soothe the savage  adfs .
